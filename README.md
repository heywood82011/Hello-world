# Hello-world
My first Repository. A blank canvas to edit, create, and learn.

I am 25 years old and new to programming. When I was in Junior high I took a beginners course on software development at school. But since then I haven't had the opportunity due to funding. So I am now getting back into the game. I want to learn everything I can.
